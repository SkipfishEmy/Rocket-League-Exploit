# Rocket-League-Exploit

The game suffers from a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The
issue is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of a UPK format file,
which can be exploited to cause a stack buffer overflow when a user crafts the
file with a large array of bytes inserted in the vicinity offset after the magic
header. Successful exploitation could allow execution of arbitrary code on the
affected machine.
